# Vs.-BronzeBoy-SF2s
Basically SF2s for my mod, Friday Night Funkin' Vs. BronzeBoy. Even if the mod somehow doesn't come out, this repository will remain. (Sorry for the sfz and dwp users.) You will have to adjust the pitch/key because they aren't professional sf2s. Specifically, for Emmy and Elliot's SF2s, you'll need to move the key to anywhere in the (Letter)7 or (Letter)8 ranges.
